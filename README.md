 This is a folder with all of the Altium Designer works I am currently working or have worked on.

 +5V to +3.3V LDO Converter
 ==========================
 Motivation: 
    To demonstrate proficieny in Altium Designer a simple LDO was created using the provided manufacturer part search for simplicity.
    A simple schematic was built per Microchip's MIC5317-3.3YM5-TR datasheet. A SOT-23 package was selected for this example to be 
    used with a SM02B-GHS-TB(LF)(SN) connector. All files will and datasheet will be included.

 Parts Used: 
    (1) MIC5317-3.3YM5-TR 
    (2) SM02B-GHS-TB(LF)(SN)
    (2) CMP-2007-03676-1
